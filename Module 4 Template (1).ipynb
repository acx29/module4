    "MERS-Cov was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, around 2600 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported globally since 2012, across 27 countries including 12 countrires in the Middle Eastern region. Of these cases, 948 deaths have been reported.\n",

    "* Economic burden\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a study published on the NLM database, the average cost of managing a MERS case at Saudi hospitals ranged from $1278.41 to $75,987.95 with a mean cost of $12,947.03 ± $19,923.14. Another study pubished on the same database reported that the MERS outbreak in 2015 was correlated \"with a reduction of 2.1 million non-citizen visitors corresponding with US $2.6 billion in tourism loss for the ROK [Republic of Korea].\"  \n",

    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle) & Societal determinants\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk factors for MERS include old age, previous medical conditions (diabetes, kidney disease, cancer), a weakened immune system, smoking, exposure to camels, and poor hygiene. Societal determinants of MERS infection include socioeconomic status, occupation, location (Saudi Arabia), and access to healthcare.\n",

    "* Symptoms\n",

    "Common symptoms of MERS include fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Symptoms usually appear within 6 days of exposure, but some people experience very mild or no symptoms.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "To diagnose MERS, a healthcare provider will perform a normal clinical evaluation (travel history, contact with infected people, camel exposure) and a physical exam. They may also take a chest X-ray, blood tests, or a nasal/throat swab. Normally, MERS is officially diagnosed with a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction test, which detects MERS RNA.\n",

    "\n",
    "Anatomy/Organ Physiology: Targets lower respiratory tract, kidneys, and immune cells via DPP4 receptor. This receptor is found in alveolar epithelial cells, kidney cells, and immune cells, which explains why MERS can cause lung failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell & Molecular Physiology: Virus binds to DPP4 receptor, viral RNA enters the cytoplasm, replicates, blocks interferons (slow immune response), delays cytokine release, results in damaged lung tissue, cell death, fluid buildup, and organ damage.\n"
